Often seen as the greatest of the Victorian novelists, Charles Dickens lived in Kent from 1816 to 1822 when his father was working in the Naval Pay Office at [Chatham Dockyard](/dickens/chatham), and again from 1856 to his death in 1870 (at [Gad’s Hill](/dickens-gads-hill), Higham). He spent many summers in [Broadstairs](/Broadstairs) 
(‘Our Watering Place’) in the 1840s and 1850s, and also wrote affectionately about [Folkestone](/19c-folkestone), (thinly disguised as 'Pavilionstone'), ''where he composed the opening scenes of _Little Dorrit_. _The Pickwick Papers_, published in instalments in 1836-37, recalls the pre-Victorian Kent of Dickens’s childhood, where coaching inns have not been displaced by railways and the practice of duelling can be invoked as a plausible plot device. _A Tale of Two Cities_ (1859), goes further back still, as Jarvis Lorry travels by coach down the '''Dover Road''' on his way to revolutionary Paris.

His two most obviously autobiographical novels, _David Copperfield_ (1850) set partly in [Dover](/dickens/docs/dickens-dover) and [Canterbury](/david-copperfield-canterbury), and _Great Expectations_ (1861) with its powerful evocation of the estuary marshes, also return to a pre-railway era in their treatment of young men whose lives are shaped by the Kent landscape. His final novel, the uncompleted [_Mystery of Edwin Drood_](http://droodinquiry.com/)  offers a notably more modern representation of '''Rochester''', one that is linked to the temptations of London opium dens and rendered dangerous by the urges of sexual jealousy.

After his death the areas of Kent most closely associated with Dickens and his novels became the focus for numerous guide writers and literary '''pilgrims'''. As the fresh air movement took hold in the early years of the twentieth century, designated Dickens ‘rambles’ and cycling tours were promoted as a means of engaging with a revered writer while escaping the demands and pollution of London.
