>The New Pier, many years old by now, for entrance to which, as being something superior, twopence is charged, is an instance of that kind of half-fulfilled promise whereof Ramsgate generally offers several evident examples. But while there is a pier there is hope, and it may yet occur to its proprietors, or to the local authorities, to say, after the manner of Mr Wemmick, out of office-hours, in Great Expectations, "Hello! Here’s a pier! Let’s do something with it!"’

F. C. Burnand (1836-1917) was an editor of the comic journal _Punch_ and author of _The Z.Z.G., or Zig Zag Guide round and about the bold and beautiful Kentish coast…_ with illustrations by Phil May. He lived in Ramsgate from at least 1875 until his death.

### Article 
Sir Francis Cowley Burnand (knighted in 1902) is best known as the editor of ''Punch'' from 1880-1906, serialising the [Grossmiths](/19c-grossmith-biography)’ runaway success _Diary of a Nobody_ in 1888. In 1897 he and _Punch_ artist Phil May adopted the Dickensian personae ‘T’other Guv’nor’ and ‘T’otherst Guv’nor’ for their collaboration on the comic but informative _Z.Z.G., or Zig Zag Guide round and about the bold and beautiful Kentish coast…_. Despite _Punch_’s habitual disdain of _Three Men in a Boat_ and its lower middle class author, May himself also worked with Jerome K. [Jerome](/19c-jerome-biography) (who as editor of _The Idler_ complained bitterly of the illustrator’s shoddy attitude to deadlines).
In the _Z.Z.G._ Burnand includes a number of knowing jokes about [Ramsgate](/19c-ramsgate) as well as [Margate](/19c-margate), [Broadstairs](/broadstairs) and [Sandwich] as if from the standpoint of an itinerant tourist. In fact the 1887 Street Directory locates a Frederick Charles Burnand at 18 Royal Crescent (where Burnand died in 1917); the 1911 census shows that while Francis’s fifth son Philip was born in Middlesex (now part of London) in 1869, his fourth daughter Mary was born in Ramsgate in 1875.  Burnand died of bronchitis on 21 April 1917, and is buried in the cemetery attached to St Augustine's Abbey church in [Ramsgate](/19c-ramsgate).
