**[Mobile Landscapes](mobile-landscapes)** was inspired by the literary pilgrimages made by Victorians themselves. Authors such as William Hughes and Frederick Kitton wrote enthusiastic accounts of their adventures as they tracked Dickens and his characters through Kent. This 21C experiment invites you to accompany two modern day Dickensians on their own journey of discovery, as they read the novels to each other from Broadstairs to Rochester.

**[Great Expectations: a Curated Walk](great-expectations-curated-walk)** starts with Pip’s fateful encounter with Magwitch in the local churchyard. But what other secrets is he keeping? Meet the characters who shape his destiny or follow him around on a map and learn more about the real ‘marsh country’ of the 1820s. But remember – nothing here is quite what it seems.

**[David Copperfield: a Curated Walk](david-copperfield-curated-walk)** takes David through Kent and down the Dover Road to find answers to some vital questions. How do others see us? What does it mean to be in love? Where is home? It may not be obvious at first, but places can move around here, so you must be careful not to get lost.
