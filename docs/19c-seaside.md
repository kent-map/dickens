As the fashionable ‘water cure’ of spas such as Bath and [[Tunbridge Wells]] moved coastwards in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, so a number of obscure fishing villages reinvented themselves as seaside resorts. Kent was an obvious beneficiary of this trend, with '''Gravesend''' in the Medway area and no fewer than seven resorts along the East coast: while '''Whitstable''' and '''Herne Bay''' never offered serious competition to the Sussex resorts of Brighton and Eastbourne, visitors were drawn in large numbers to [Broadstairs](/19c-broadstairs), [Ramsgate](/19c-ramsgate) and [Margate](/19c-Margate) in Thanet, and to [Folkestone](/19c-folkestone) and [Dover](/19c-dover) in Sheppey. 

Women of all ages benefited from the greater freedom and healthier lifestyle of the seaside holiday. Princess Victoria spent three months in [Broadstairs](/broadstairs-19th-century) in 1829 and stayed in [Ramsgate](/Ramsgate-19th-century) in 1835. Another teenage girl, [Emily Shore](/19c-shore.biography), kept a journal of her visit to Thanet in the summer of 1831. Like [[Anna Maria Hussey]], who holidayed in [Dover](/19c-dover) in 1836, Emily made the trip by steamboat.

By the early decades of the 20th century visitors would be able to enjoy a body of holiday fiction set in the resort they were visiting: _Maggie of Margate: a Seaside Sensation,_ _The Passenger to 'Folkestone_, _The Beauty of Broadstairs_ and _A Girl of Thanet_, to name but a few.
